# FDASurfaces.jl
Julia package implementing the method described in ["Statistical Analysis of Functions on Surfaces"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2019.1635479) by Lila and Aston 2019. Enables functional data analysis on data laying on smooth manifolds.

We also have ported some of the [Fshapes Tool Kit functions](https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/benjamin.charlier/fshapesTk) from MATLAB, C, and CUDA to Julia.
